              We re-did our website twice in a 12 month period. There was no
              comparison between the the designer and james. Professional,
              Creative, Attentive to Detail, Excellent Communication…If I had
              contracted with james the first time I would not have had to do it
              twice.

              I went to james with a basic “feel” I wanted in a website. He
              helped flush out the visual layout and content. james’s services
              are bargain when you weigh the cost versus the product you
              receive. I will be working with him again in future endeavors.
              Thanks again!

              Our site is beautiful! It is easy to navigate. The support has
              been remarkable for WordPress; if I don’t understand something, or
              can’t accomplish a task, James is a extremely talented web
              designer. We are amazed from where traffic to our site comes; we
              are a moderate sized nonprofit and now we are having global
              visitors.
